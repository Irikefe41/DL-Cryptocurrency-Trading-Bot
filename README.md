## Deep-Learning-Crypto-Bot

#### This bot exploit an hierarchical CNN network in predicting the daily trading bias of cryptocurrency assets.

#### CNN structure explored:

### Inputs ======(Convolutions)=====> Feature Maps ======== (Subsampling) =========> (feature maps) ========== (Convolutions)=======>(feature maps) ===========(subsampling) =========> (Fully Connected)=======> (Output Layer)

#### Project leverages Keras CNN (convolutional neural network) as a classifier to predict multivariate time series data (multiple x features, or variables)

#### Training on 80% , Testing on 20%
